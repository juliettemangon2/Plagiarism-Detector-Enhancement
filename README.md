# Plagiarism Detector Enhancement
The reliance on automatic plagiarism detection software has increased in academia, but the convenience of using this software often comes at a cost—a high rate of false positives. We decided to write a plagiarism detection program with the express focus of ensuring a low rate of false positives. We implemented existing research on plagiarism detection techniques which we had found in several scholarly articles, primarily experimenting with TF-IDF scores, cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and n-gram classes. Once we replicated the results stated in the published articles, we improved the model by using multiprocessors to decrease our runtime and changed the computation technique for our TF-IDF scores to improve our F-score. Our model’s runtime decreased from 480 seconds to 98 seconds for our training corpus, and we improved the maximum F-score in our training corpus from 72.73% to 73.68%. The results on our larger evaluation corpus were not as successful as we would have hoped, with a continued improvement in runtime but a significantly worse maximum F-score of 62.07%.
